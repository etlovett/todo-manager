A super basic TODO manager, because the world needs more of those.

Primary Goals:
1. Have a Node.js-based server that talks to a browser-based front-end.
2. TODOs are stored in a basic flat text file that can therefore be edited and searched outside of this TODO manager.
3. I get to play with Node.js and other fun technologies.
